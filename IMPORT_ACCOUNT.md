# ✅ CONFIRMED: Your System is Ready!

## 🎯 The Problem (What You're Seeing):

In MetaMask you see:

- ❌ **"Network fee Alert"** (in red)
- ❌ **"Review alert"** button (instead of "Confirm")
- ❌ Account 2 has **0 ETH or very little ETH**

## ✅ The Solution (Takes 1 Minute):

### **Import the Test Account with 9,999 ETH:**

## 📱 Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Open MetaMask Extension

### 2. Click Your Account Name

- At the top where it says **"Account 2"**
- A dropdown menu will appear

### 3. At the Bottom of Dropdown:

- Click **"+ Add account or hardware wallet"**
- OR **"Import Account"**

### 4. Select "Import Account"

### 5. Paste This Private Key:

```
0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

### 6. Click "Import"

### 7. ✅ Success!

You now have a new account with:

- **Address:** 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
- **Balance:** 9,999.99 ETH (FREE test ETH!)

---

## 🎬 Now Try Your Transaction Again:

### 1. Make Sure You're Using the New Account

- Switch to the newly imported account (should be Account 3 or similar)
- Check balance shows ~10,000 ETH

### 2. Refresh Your Browser

### 3. Connect Wallet

- Click "Connect Wallet"
- Select the new account (with 10,000 ETH)

### 4. Try Minting/Supply Again

## 💡 Why This Works:

**Before:**

- Account 2: 0 ETH → Can't pay gas fees → "Alert" message

**After:**

- New imported account: 10,000 ETH → Can pay gas fees → "Confirm" button works!

**This is PERFECT because:**

- ✅ FREE test ETH (not real money!)
- ✅ Shows real MetaMask workflow
- ✅ All transactions work
- ✅ Professional demo quality

**The "$0.17 ETH" gas fee:**
