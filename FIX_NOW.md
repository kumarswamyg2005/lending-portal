# ⚡ INSTANT FIX - Confirm Button Not Working

## 🚨 PROBLEM:

MetaMask shows **"Review alert"** instead of **"Confirm"**  
❌ Button is disabled/gray  
❌ Can't complete transaction

## ✅ SOLUTION (30 Seconds):

### Import Test Account with 10,000 ETH:

1. **Open MetaMask**

2. **Click your account name** (top - where it says "Account 2")

3. **Click "Import Account"** (at bottom of dropdown)

4. **Paste this:**

   ```
   0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
   ```

5. **Click "Import"**

6. **✅ DONE!** You now have **10,000 TEST ETH**

7. **Refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)

8. **Try transaction again** → **Confirm button works!**

## ✅ After Import You'll See:

- New account with address: **0xf39Fd...92266**
- Balance: **~10,000 ETH**
- Network: **Hardhat Local**
- Transaction popup shows: **"Confirm"** (blue, clickable) ✅

---

## 🎯 Why This Works:

**Before:** Account has 0 ETH → Can't pay gas → "Alert"  
**After:** Account has 10,000 ETH → Can pay gas → "Confirm" works!
