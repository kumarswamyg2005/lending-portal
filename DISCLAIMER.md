# ⚠️ DISCLAIMER - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

## This is a TEST/DEMO Project for Educational Purposes Only

### 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTICES

**NO REAL MONEY IS USED IN THIS PROJECT**

This DeFi Lending Platform is a **demonstration and educational project** designed to showcase blockchain development skills and DeFi concepts.

### What This Project IS:

✅ **Educational Demo** - Learn about DeFi lending mechanics  
✅ **Test Environment** - Runs on Hardhat local blockchain (localhost:8545)  
✅ **Test Tokens** - Uses mock ERC20 tokens (DAI, USDC, WETH) with NO real value  
✅ **Learning Tool** - Understand smart contracts, MetaMask integration, and blockchain transactions  
✅ **Safe to Experiment** - All transactions use test ETH provided by Hardhat

### What This Project IS NOT:

❌ **NOT a Real Financial Product** - This is not a production-ready application  
❌ **NOT Using Real Money** - All tokens and ETH are TEST ONLY with zero monetary value  
❌ **NOT Deployed to Mainnet** - Only runs on local test blockchain  
❌ **NOT Audited** - Smart contracts have not undergone professional security audits  
❌ **NOT Investment Advice** - For educational demonstration purposes only

### Technical Details

- **Blockchain**: Hardhat Local Network (http://127.0.0.1:8545)
- **Chain ID**: 31337 (Hardhat default test chain)
- **Network Type**: Local Development Network
- **Smart Contracts**: Test deployment only
- **Tokens**: Mock ERC20 with no real value
- **Accounts**: Test accounts with test ETH (no real funds)

### Security Notice

⚠️ **DO NOT:**

- Deploy this to a mainnet or testnet without proper security audits
- Use real cryptocurrency with this application
- Treat this as a production-ready financial application
- Share real private keys or seed phrases

✅ **DO:**

- Use only for learning and demonstration
- Use Hardhat test accounts only
- Experiment in the local development environment
- Study the code to learn about DeFi mechanics

### Liability

The authors and contributors of this project:

- Provide this software "AS IS" without any warranties
- Are NOT responsible for any financial losses
- Do NOT recommend using this in production
- Are NOT liable for any damages arising from use or misuse

### Educational Purpose

This project demonstrates:

- Smart contract development with Solidity
- DeFi lending/borrowing mechanics
- Flash loan implementation
- MetaMask wallet integration
- Blockchain transaction handling
- Interest rate calculations
- Collateralization ratios

### Questions?

If you're unsure whether this uses real money:

- **It does NOT use real money**
- **All value is simulated for testing**
- **Runs on a local test blockchain only**
- **Safe to experiment without financial risk**

### For Production Use

If you want to build a real DeFi application:

1. Complete professional security audits
2. Use established DeFi protocols and libraries
3. Follow best practices for smart contract security
4. Implement comprehensive testing
5. Consider economic attack vectors
6. Obtain proper legal/regulatory guidance
7. Never deploy unaudited code to mainnet
